# C-and-Cpp-SQLite-interface-routines-
using code blocks or any compiler that fully support gcc and g++ run the all code that is named  c_with_cpp.cpp and all the outputs will be created and stored within the directory you will just have to list to and execute ./a.out file.This is the command.
# g++ c_with_cpp.cpp -l sqlite3

  2 .createtable.c
 3.inseert.c
4.create.c
